    LICHTERMAN NATURE CENTER
</header>
<h2>    <p>Here is an animal that can be found at Lichterman Nature Center. There are many more in the park but this is one you are likely to see while visiting the park. You may see this type of bird if you hike the lake trails. They spend their time around water, such as lakes. There are also very many other species of birds, water and forest, that can be seen living in or flying through the park. The park has an abundance of Canada geese which are usually found along the lake trails. There are also water snakes that are often observed on these trails. In the forest and meadow trails, you may see kingsnakes and rat snakes. Box turtles are common in the park, too. There are also foxes and the occasional coyote or deer. </p></h2>
