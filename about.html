    ABOUT
</header>
<h2><p>I decided to create a website about a topic that has been a favorite of mine since I was a child. Visiting the places mentioned on this site has been a favorite hobby of mine for all my life. I love spending time outside especially in nature. I find it fascinating that there are so many different types of wild animals living in ecosystems in my hometown. I get excited whenever I see a wild animal that is rarely seen or not supposed to be in the area. This is the one area I would want to work in besides software development. And if I have time, I would love to do something with wildlife, possibly with my state, Tennessee. I have always wanted to in addition to being a coder.</p></h2>
