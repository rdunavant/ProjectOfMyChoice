        <p>This is an animal that has been found at Overton Park. If you walk here, there is a chance you will see one.</p></div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>Many people have seen this type of snake while visiting the park as it is somewhat common. The snake loves wooded areas, especially with a small water source. They may often be found near the water.</p></div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>There are several other species of snake that live in the park, including the corn snake which looks similar to the copperhead although non-venomous and harmless.</p></div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>There are also a handfull of different types of forest birds, foxes, and coyotes that are occasionally seen in and around the park.</p></div>
    <div class="border">
        <p>The park is in midtown and within close proximity to Crosstown, so it is very convenient for those living in the heart of Memphis city limits.</p></div>
